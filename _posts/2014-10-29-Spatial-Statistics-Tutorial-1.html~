    1. Itty-Bitty Spatial Statistics
   
---

## Overview of Tutorial #1

This post explores simple examples of spatial statistics that can be computed by hand.

We will focus on:

* How Values in Spatial Statistics are Computed.
* The Effects of Periodicity and Otherwise.

All of the code outputs are from [``StatsSanityCheck.m``](#).

## The Delta Microstructure

The delta microstructure is a sufficient condition for a heterogenous medium.  One voxel
in a spatial rending is not the same as the others.

## The Vertical Structure

The vertical structure introduces heterogenity in a single direction and a periodic structure.
