SpatialStatisticsFFT
====================

The spatial statistics repository is a suite of codes to compute pair correlation functions and spatial correlation functions (ie. pair correlation functions for specific vector distances).  The code base is written in MATLAB for both Windows 7 Ultimate and Snow Leopard.  This repository contains a set of utilities to compute advanced statistics using both naive and optimized algorithms to compute spatial correlation functions.

Temporary Documentation

Installation
============


1a. Pull from GitHub in Matlab
+ Open a Matlab Instantiation
+ cd to the directory you want to place Spatial_Statistics
+ In the Matlab command line execute
  !git clone https://github.com/tonyfast/Spatial_Statistics.git
  
1b. Download frim GitHub
+ Download the repository from https://github.com/tonyfast/Spatial_Statistics/archive/master.zip
+ Unzip the package to a directory where Spatial_Statistics will rest in

2. Add SpatialStatisticsFFT and SpatialStatisticsFFT/fuctions to the Matlab path


Once the file is added a subdirectory then the coding suite can be used.

Principal Analysis Matlab Code
==============================
I suggest using Mark Tygert's randomized Principal Component Analysis function that can be downloaded from http://cims.nyu.edu/~tygert/pca.m .
