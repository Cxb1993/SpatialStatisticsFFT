SpatialStatisticsFFT
====================

In practice, materials science information must be evaluated and compared in a statistical manner.  Traditional materials science practice involves pre-processing steps that identify material features; from there statistics of the features are extracted.  Examples of feature statistics are orientition distribution functions, volume fraction, variance; the statistics are feature identifiers in materials science. 

Spatial statistics provide a powerful objective statistical quantifier for materials science information.  Spatial statistics have effective statistical measures embedded in them such as [volume fraction]() and [specific surface area]().  

Spatial statistics have shown diverse applications in

* Metallic feature identification 
* Homogenization relations in fuel cells
* Electronic potential identification in Molecular Dynamics


Principal Analysis Matlab Code
==============================
I suggest using Mark Tygert's randomized Principal Component Analysis function that can be downloaded from http://cims.nyu.edu/~tygert/pca.m .
